# AI-Toolbox

## Introduction

Algorithm Engineer Toolbox, for the purpose of quickly iterating new ideas

This repository is not a algorithm library that provides many directly callable interfaces, but a flexible toolbox that contains many independent algorithm demos. It is designed to improve the efficiency of the work, extract the algorithm of interest, and slightly modify the demo program to quickly verify your ideas.

At present, the project is still in the initial stage, mainly covering algorithms
 in the field of image processing and computer vision, later will cover algorithms in other fields such as natural language processing and machine learning. continue to update...

## AI-Toolbox visualization

Here is a visualization of some of the algorithms involved in the toolbox. You can quickly browse through the toolbox for algorithm that interests you.

All sample images used are for research purposes only and will be deleted immediately if infringement occurs. Have fun~
